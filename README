== Emily is Thirty

When my wife was about to turn thirty, I put together a website for her to gather some memories.
I blasted all my friends across all social media, but I had messed up my DNS settings, and didn't get
to gather as many memories as I could before her actual birthday.

=== Technologies
MongoDB is my database and API. With such a small app, I barely needed a middle tier.

Ruby on Rails for the server side code. I didn't set up any of the RoR, really. Just enough to return the initial
html page with the javascript running out of the public folder.

Javascript:
Require for front end modules. Backbone for connecting to the MongoDB API and managing the models and data.
Handlebars for the html templates.
